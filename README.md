# Fortnite External

Fortnite cheat updated to 20.10!

Project Information :
- Has actual file management
- Should be pretty "clean" and simple to use
- Creates a device and window using D3DX9
- Uses ImGui to render menu
- Has a simple config setup

What is left to add :
- Add your own drawing function in draw.hpp
- Update/implement your own driver and make it undetected
- Change the overlay (dont use this basic d3d9 create window overlay, be creative)
- Some other basic stuff you can figure out (i.e xorstr strings etc)

I dont see myself updating this project anymore, this is something i quickly made while apex was installing ðŸ˜¹
(Yes i basically combined godfather and vase into one!)
Enjoy!!!!!
